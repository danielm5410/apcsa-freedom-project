I've looked over a little bit of the C++ and the unreal engine docmentation to try out how challenging it is and to see if i wanted to continue on with this tool

Throughout these past months, me and my partner Jimmy have been deciding what we want to do and ultimately ended up working on an AR FPS game against npcs. We would use the IDE Xcode while coding in Swift. I have taken a look  at some of the swift documentation and looked into the AR documentation and will try it out when I get home. We plan to implement the ar kit and get ar to work before modeling and coding the rest of the game.
